# Pizzeria Management System

This project was developed to modernize the order management process at Carlos' Pizzeria, integrating solutions that make daily operations more efficient and accessible. The system allows the integration of orders via WhatsApp and phone calls, while also offering features that streamline workflows.

**KEY FEATURES**

1. **WhatsApp Order Integration**  
   The system enables direct order reception through WhatsApp. Using the wa.me link, it automates communication with Selenium, accessing a saved Mozilla session, ensuring faster and more efficient communication.

2. **Full CRUD for Clients, Pizzas, and Orders**  
   The system provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for managing clients, pizzas, and orders. Built with the Flet framework, the front-end delivers a user-friendly, modern interface.

3. **Power BI Reports**  
   Interactive reports generated in Power BI offer a detailed view of the pizzeria's performance, including order and sales metrics.

4. **Excel Data Export**  
   Data export is done using Pandas and Openpyxl libraries, allowing relevant information to be exported directly to Excel spreadsheets for further analysis.

5. **Accessibility and Inclusion**  
   Designed with accessibility in mind, the system is fully compatible with screen readers, making it usable for visually impaired users. Additionally, color optimizations ensure the interface is accessible for users with color blindness.

6. **Receipt Generation**  
   The system includes receipt generation for each completed order, simplifying transaction control and documentation.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

1. **Flet**: Framework for front-end development.
2. **Python**: Used for back-end development.
3. **SQLite**: Lightweight, efficient database for data storage.
4. **Pandas & Openpyxl**: For data export and manipulation in Excel.
5. **Selenium**: For WhatsApp message automation, utilizing a saved Mozilla session.

**CONCLUSION**

This project combines technology, accessibility, and automation to deliver a complete management solution for pizzerias, facilitating the order process and offering full integration with WhatsApp, interactive reports, and data export to Excel.
